Just dont confuse the game in RPG for any actual gameplay but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system that deserves recognition allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the users daily life However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups After a solid month of use building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks and setting up several habit based routines the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next While autogrouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared once again losing the important ones in the clutter User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series With no social aspect currently attached to the app as at ver 2230 there is no task sharing There is also no designated pcmaclinux front end for desktop syncing Finally its expensive as apps go A one off of 75 will get the full version or about 250 a month paid yearly which removes ads and

or tab that would open a stationary bar at the top or a floating window that moves with the screen Second issue is definitely a software bug having to do with the line numbering Once a line numbering

app in the future Thanks a lot If true That is really bad news  backup is a basic necessity so nonpremium version will become practically useless on the long term In addition premium costs twice as much for a single year than lets say OsmAnd for eternity And that is a much more complex app  the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits Tasks is a really nice app except that swichingt between sublistslists is unreasonably slow with some unique and essential features But this wracks it it will drive me away Possibly others too Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGES RESPONSE That is fair enough except for one important detail all the people using your free app are now forced to decide  if they want to have a meaningful app  to pay or search for another app Premium app should only add features and not restrict free apps capabilities If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing people will buy it Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay I payed for a number of apps all cheaper than yours btw and actually my plan was to paydonate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support This change is different I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc just that you should not remove the free local backup or any other feature Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start Best wishes RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGES SECOND RESPONSE Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free My problem is different If we
